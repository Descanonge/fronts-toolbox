    Examples of the various algorithms.

These examples are automatically updated. They can be used to visually check
the algorithms correctness.

Some examples use idealized data generated on the spot (:mod:`._fields`), some
can use data samples stored on Zenodo (`doi:10.5281/zenodo.15769617
<doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15769617>`__). You will need `pooch
<https://pypi.org/project/pooch/>`__ and Xarray installed to run them
successfully.
